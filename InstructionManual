DB Schema
There are 3 main DB tables
1. CookieEmailMap -- As the name suggests, it contains the mapping of cookies to the owner email address
2. CouponDB -- Contains all the created coupon button details
3. GlobalCouponWallet4 -- Contains the mapping of email address and coupon id. Essentially it contains the information which user saved which coupon

There are few other assistive DB like
1. Create_SignUp -- Contains email of folks who are authorized to create coupon button
2. PPP_Merchant_Id_Wepsite_Map -- Contains the mapping of PayPal Marchant Id and the Website associated with it. This table dictates which merchant website coupons can be created. 
	Also if the merchant does not put in the PayPal Merchant Id then this table is used to the PayPal Merchant Id.
